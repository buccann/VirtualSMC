Hi, i've a real macbook and i think virtualSMC can help me with a problem.
I've one of the temperature sensors broken so the system runs as if it's burning hot
and throttles both the cpu and gpu :( is it possible with this kext to ignore all
the temperature sensors and tell the mac to run as it should?


Thanks in advance
